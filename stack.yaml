# This is the implicit global project's config file, which is only used when
# 'stack' is run outside of a real project.  Settings here do _not_ act as
# defaults for all projects.  To change stack's default settings, edit
# 'C:\sr\config.yaml' instead.
#
# For more information about stack's configuration, see
